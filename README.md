# Phishing-Site-URLs-
phishing attacks are the practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source
Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message.
A spoofed email ostensibly from myuniversity.edu is mass-distributed to as many faculty members as possible. The email claims that the userâ€™s password is about to expire. Instructions are given to go to myuniversity.edu/renewal to renew their password within 24 hours.>
